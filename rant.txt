# RANT

It took some testing and time to figure out the (known) problems (limitations)
of terragrunt's "run-all" commands.
The problems mostly arise when the commands are run non-interactively.

What it comes down to is this...

DESTROY:
"terragrunt run-all destroy" works as expected.
It finds all modules under the working directory and deletes them while (AFAIK) respecting dependency ordering.

APPLY:
"terragrunt run-all apply" ignores dependencies (unless you run it interactively)

PLAN:
"terragrunt run-all plan" does not work across dependent modules that have not been built yet.
  Specifically, it does not give a recursive plan, showing what would happen if you were
  to run TG Apply and interactively build all dependencies.
  To be fair, it does work interactively, or when run against one module with no dependencies.
Per https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/cli-options/run-all,
  "[WARNING] Using run-all with plan is currently broken for certain use cases"

The problem with "plan" is such that you can't use it non-interactively (with dependencies)
except to confirm that your existing (just applied) infrastructure matches the desired state.
