#   Use the "dependencies" block to force creation of
#   all the modules required to build the entire system.

# Include the top-level terragrunt.hcl file

# - Manage the remote_state
# - Manage the default Provider(s)
# - Assign some inputs (e.g. account, region, environment)

# MODULE PARAMETERS
#   These are the variables we have to pass in to use the module.
#   This defines the parameters that are common across all environments.
#   TG transforms these to "TF_VAR_<input_name>=<input_value>" in the TF run.
#
# Extra/unused inputs are ignored since they're just passed as environment variables
